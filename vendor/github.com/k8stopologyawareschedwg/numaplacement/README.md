# numalocality: efficient per-NUMA container placement encoding

This package provides wire-efficient encoding of the NUMA locality of kubernetes containers.
"NUMA Locality" means the single NUMA node from which a container gets all its exclusively assigned resources,
like devices, CPU cores, memory areas. If, for example, a container C1 has all resources assigned and pinned
to the same NUMA node N, we therefore classify C1 with NUMA Affinity to N (C1=N).
Multi-affinity is not supported yet.
